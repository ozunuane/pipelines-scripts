Documentation:

This Terraform code creates an AWS security group with the specified name and description. The VPC ID is passed as a variable, and the security group is created within that VPC.

The security group allows incoming traffic based on a set of rules defined in the rules variable. Each rule is defined as a key-value pair in the rules map, with the key being the rule's description and the value being a map of properties such as from_port, to_port, protocol, allowed_cidr_block, and security_groups. The dynamic block iterates over each rule in the rules map and creates an ingress rule for it, using the properties specified in the value map.

The security group also allows all outbound traffic, with no restrictions.

Finally, the security group is tagged with the specified Name and Environment.
